In linux when we create the file and same time group will be create with same name

User Management
----------------
1.User Creation
when we create user we will use useradd command and to set password will use passwd user name 
example: useradd Basha, passwd Basha
to get know whether user created or not we will check in cat /etc/passwd
to get know the groups getent group, when user is created automatically group is created with same name 
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config, in this default linux server password authentication is no , enable password authentication after enable the password authentication we need to restart sshd 
command systemctl restart sshd , sshd -t command we will use to know if any error in sshd_config file
to connect with user Basha, ssh Basha@ip

2 Group creation
groupadd Devops12
every user has two groups one is primary and another one secondary, to add user to group command is usermod -g groupname username,
example: usermod -g Devops12 Basha
